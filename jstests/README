These tests are intended to be run with jstests.py.  They have been converted from tests
available in http://www.w3c-test.org/webapps/DOMCore/tests/submissions/Ms2ger/.

There are two targets in the Makefile to run these tests.
'test-summary' runs the tests and presents a short summary of the results.
'test-detailed' runs the tests and shows the results of each test case.
If you use the latter target, you may want to limit which tests you run.

You can specify which tests to run by specifying TEST_PAT.
For example:
  make test-detailed TEST_PAT=CharacterData
will return the results of running all of the tests in files matching the pattern *CharacterData*.js.

To run the tests, you need to set JS_PATH and JSTESTS_PATH as environment variables.
These should be the path to the directory containing your JavaScript shell
and to the directory containing jstests.py, respectively.

Note that the top shell.js is taken from jstests.py and sets up the testing infrastructure.
